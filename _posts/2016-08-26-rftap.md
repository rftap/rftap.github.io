title:  "What is RFtap?"
categories: blog
---

RFtap is a simple protocol designed to provide Radio Frequency (RF) metadata about packets, such as:

* Accurate signal and noise power
* Accurate timing and phase information
* Accurate [Carrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_frequency) and [Doppler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect) frequencies of every packet, and more.

RFtap bridges the gap between [Software Defined Radio (SDR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_radio) platforms (such as [GNU Radio](http://gnuradio.org/), [Pothos](http://www.pothosware.com/), [liquidsdr](http://liquidsdr.org/), [LuaRadio](http://luaradio.io/)) and conventional network monitoring and packet analysis tools (such as [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/), [TShark](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/tshark.html), [tcpdump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcpdump), [Scapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scapy)), allowing the access and manipulation of novel RF metadata from packets while remaining within the comfortable and mature environment of conventional networking tools.

The RFtap protocol is inspired by the [radiotap protocol](http://www.radiotap.org/); however it is designed to encapsulate any type of packet (not just Wi-Fi), and preserve the exact RF attributes of each packet without loss of accuracy.

## Specifications

## Using RFtap (as a Consumer)

The most natural way to process RFtap packets is through standard networking tools and file formats such as Wireshark, TShark, pcap files, editcap, mergecap, etc. Use Wireshark/TShark built-in RFtap dissector for filtering and analytics. Some examples:

Filter packets above a [Signal-to-Noise ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-to-noise_ratio):

Print the transmitter [MAC address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address) and the received [Doppler frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect) (in Hertz) of each Wi-Fi packet:

```
$ tshark -i lo -q -T fields -e wlan.ta -e rftap.freqofs

## Using RFtap (as a Producer)

RFtap packets can be produced using GNU Radio **RFtap encapsulation** block. This block can be connected to any GNU Radio block that produces PDU messages (the grey-colored port in GNU Radio blocks). The encapsulation block automatically extracts common metadata fields from the PDU, encoding them into the appropriate RFtap fields.

See [Tutorial: encapsulating RDS packets with RFtap]({% post_url 2016-08-27-decoding-rds-with-rftap %}):

</div>

Alternatively, RFtap packets can be easily created in any language, because of the simple structure:

```c
struct rftap_hdr {
    le32 magic;  // signature: "RFta"
    le16 len32;  // length
    le16 flags;  // bitfield indicating presence of fields
    le32 data[];  // the rftap fields
} __attribute__((packed));
```

For example, to encode Signal-to-Noise (SNR) metadata for an arbitrary packet:

```c
struct my_packet {
    // RFtap header + optional fields
    le32 magic;
    le16 len32;
    le16 flags;
    float snr;

    char packet_data[123];  // packet data
} __attribute__((packed));

void prepare_packet(my_packet *pkt) {
    pkt->magic = 0x61744652UL;  // fixed signature ("RFta" in hex)
    pkt->len32 = 3;  // we use 3x 32-bit words: magic, len+flags, snr
    pkt->flags = 0x0080;  // "SNR" field is present (bit #7 is ON)

    pkt->snr = 12.34;  // fill your Signal-to-Noise, in dB (decibels)
    pkt->data = // fill your packet data here.
    // Done! Packet is ready to be sent, or saved to pcap file...
}
```
